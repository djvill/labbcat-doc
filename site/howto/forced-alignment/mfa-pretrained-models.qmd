# MFA and Pretrained Acoustic Models

The *Montreal Forced Aligner* (MFA) is a third-party tool developed by Michael McAuliffe and others for time aligning orthographic and phonological forms from a pronunciation dictionary to orthographically transcribed audio files. It is 
[open source software](https://github.com/MontrealCorpusTools/Montreal-Forced-Aligner/blob/main/LICENSE) 
based on the 
[Kaldi ASR toolkit](http://kaldi-asr.org/).

LaBB-CAT includes a layer manager module called "MFA Manager" which integrates with MFA in order to facilitate forced alignment of LaBB-CAT corpus data.

The layer manager can work in two modes:

- *Train and Align* - acoustic models are trained on the data you want to align, which can be in any language as long as you have a pronunciation dictionary for it.
- *Pre-trained Models/Dictionaries* - pre-trained models and pronunciation dictionaries are supplied by the Montreal Forced Aligner and used for forced alignment. Languages for which dictionaries are available listed on the MFA website and include:
    - English
    - French
    - German
    - Brazilian Portuguese
    - Spanish
    - Catalan

These instructions assume that your corpus is in one of these languages, and uses the *Pre-trained Models/Dictionaries* approach...

## MFA Installation

MFA is a 3rd-party tool that LaBB-CAT integrates with via a Layer Manager module. MFA is *not included* as part of LaBB-CAT, and so it must be installed on the server you have installed LaBB-CAT on before you can integrate LaBB-CAT with it.

If MFA has not been installed already, please follow the steps detailed under
[MFA Installation](mfa-install.qmd). This is a one-time process.

## Forced Alignment

Once MFA has been installed, you have to install the MFA Manager, which is the LaBB-CAT module that provides MFA with all the data it needs, and then saves to alignments MFA produces back to your database.

1. Select the *layer managers* menu option.
1. Follow the *List of layer managers that are not yet installed* link.
1. Find *MFA Manager* in the list, and press its *Install* button and then press *Install* again.
1. As long as MFA has been installed for all users, you should see a box that's already filled in with the location that MFA was installed to.
1. Click *Configure* to continue the layer manager installation.
1. You will see a window open with some information about integrating with MFA, including the information you've already read above.
1. Now you need to add a phrase layer for the HTK configuration:
    - *Layer ID*: `mfa`
    - *Type*: *Text*
    - *Alignment*: *Intervals*
    - *Manager*: *MFA Manager*
    - *Generate*: *always*
    - *Description*: *MFA alignment time*
1. When you configure the layer, set the following options:
    - *Dictionary Name*: the dictionary language, e.g. *english_uk_mfa*
    - *Pretrained Acoustic Models*: the models language, e.g. *english_mfa*
    - The rest of the options can be left as their default values.
    - If you're curious about what the configuration options do, hover your mouse over each option to see a `tool tip' that describes what the option is for.
1. Press *Set Parameters*
1. Press *Regenerate*  
   You will see a progress bar while LaBB-CAT force-aligns all the transcripts in the corpus, which may take a few minutes.
1. When the layer manager has finished, you'll see a message saying:  
   *Complete - words and phones from selected utterances are now aligned.*
