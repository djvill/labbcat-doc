# Phonemic Tagging with CMU Pronouncing Dictionary

LaBB-CAT can be integrated with the 
[CMU Pronouncing Dictionary](http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict), 
which is a free pronouncing dictionary of English maintained by the Speech Group in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. The pronunciations are based on American English, so are suitable for American English recordings. 

Integrating this lexicon with LaBB-CAT is achieved with the "CMU Dictionary Layer Manager". As CMU has kindly granted permission to freely distribute the dictionary file, you don't need to download the file from the CMU site; it's included in the layer manager that you will install.

## Install the Layer Manager

First, the CMUDict layer manager module must be installed:

1. Select the *layer managers* menu option.
1. Follow the *List of layer managers that are not yet installed* link near the bottom.
1. Find "CMU Pronouncing Dictionary" in the list, and press its *Install* button.  
  You will see a progress bar while the layer manager loads the data from the dictionary file into the LaBB-CAT database. This will take a minute or so.
1. Once it's finished, you will see a new window open with information about the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary layer manager. Reading this information page, you will see some instructions on how to create a pronunciation annotation layer.

# Create an Annotation Layer

To create a new layer with CMUdict annotations:

1. Select on the *word layers* menu option - this will display a list of all the word layers you already have in the database.
1. At the top of the list, there's a blank form for creating a new layer  - fill this form in:
    - ID - enter a one- or two-word description - e.g. `phonemes`
    - layer type - select *Phonological*
    - layer manager - select *CMU Pronouncing Dictionary*
    - alignment - select *None* (as these are simply tags on the orthographic words)
    - generate - select *Always*
1. Press the *New* button to create the layer  
  You will see a form that allows you to specify various options.  You can use the online help for that page to guide you, but the default options are probably fine to go ahead with.
1. Press *Save*
1. Press *Regenerate*.  
   You will see a progress bar while the layer manager annotates all the transcripts that have already been uploaded.

LaBB-CAT will then generate annotations for all the transcripts you already have in your database.  If you have a lot of data, this may take a while.  

From now on, when you upload a new transcript, the CMUdict annotations will automatically be generated for it.
