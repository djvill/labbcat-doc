# 2. Uploading Data

In this exercise you will:

1.  Upload a transcript manually
2.  Upload many transcripts at once using the batch uploader
3.  Import participant data from a CSV file
4.  Define a speech elicitation task for gathering data

After this you will have a small corpus in your LaBB-CAT database.

Before you start, download and unzip
[QuakeStories.zip](https://publicdata.canterbury.ac.nz/Research/NZILBB/labbcat/QuakeStories.zip)
so you\'ve got the demonstration data for uploading to your corpus.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Manual Upload

1.  In LaBB-CAT, click the *upload* option in the menu.
2.  Click the first option, *upload transcripts*.
3.  Click the left-hand *Choose File* button and select the file in the
    "QuakeStories" folder called: \
    "BR178LK\_MargaretSpencer.eaf". \
    When you select a file, a new row of *Choose File* buttons will
    appear below the first. This is for adding more transcripts in the
    'episode'. An 'episode' is a set of transcripts that belong together
    because they were recorded during the same session. In our case,
    each recording session has only one recording.
4.  Next to *Media* on the first row, click *Choose File*.
5.  Each transcript has an audio file and a video file, and you want to
    upload both. \
    Click the file called "BR178LK\_MargaretSpencer.mp4", then hold down
    the *\<Shift\>* key on your keyboard and click the file called
    "BR178LK\_MargaretSpencer.wav". Then click *Open*.
6.  Ensure the *Corpus* option is *QB*
7.  Ensure the *Type* option is *interview*
8.  Click *Upload* \
    \
    Each ELAN transcript has a number of Tiers defined in it:
    -   one for the participant\'s utterances,
    -   another for an 'interviewer' if there is one,
    -   one for noise annotations,
    -   one for transcriber comments, and
    -   one for topic annotations. \
        \
        Each tier must be mapped to a LaBB-CAT annotation layer.
9.  LaBB-CAT has analysed the structure of the ELAN transcript and
    pre-selected some default options for layer mappings. For the demo
    data, these defaults are correct, so you needn\'t change anything. \
    Click *Set Mappings* to continue. \
    This will display a page listing all the speakers in the transcript,
    so you can select which one is the 'main participant', which is the
    speaker selected by default for searches and other processing.
10. Ensure that *BR178LK\_MargaretSpencer* is ticked, and the
    interviewer is not ticked, and click *Set Main Participants*. \
    This will display a page with the name of transcript you uploaded,
    with an *edit meta-data* link, and a progress bar (which may have
    already finished).
11. Click *edit meta data* \
    This will display the attributes for the transcript.
12. Check that you remembered to set *Type* to *interview*. If not, you
    can fix that on this page, and click *Save Changes*.
13. Below the transcript attributes is a list of participants. \
    Click *BR178LK\_MargaretSpencer*. \
    This will display the participant attributes we defined in an
    earlier exercise.
14. BR178LK\_MargaretSpencer is an 'English'-speaking 'female' who is
    between '66 and 75 years' old, who grew up in 'Christchurch', in the
    'North Canterbury' region of 'New Zealand\'. \
    Set her attributes to reflect that, and click *Save*.
15. Below the participant attributes, there is a list of transcripts
    that the speaker appears in (in this case, only one). Each has
    various buttons; each button is labelled, but hover your mouse over
    each one, and a 'tip' will appear that provides a little more
    information about what the button does. \
    Click name of the *BR178LK\_MargaretSpencer.eaf* transcript.
16. You will now see LaBB-CAT\'s 'interactive transcript' page for the
    transcript. \
    \
    At the top there is a heading, a list of speakers, and then below
    this, the lines from the transcript, their speakers in the margin.
    This includes the words the participants utter, and also any noises,
    comments, and other events that were put in the transcript in
    ELAN. \
    \
    In the top right corner are some playback controls; click the play
    button. You will see a shaded rectangle following the participant\'s
    speech. \
    \
    Try the other controls to see what they do. \
     
17. Now click on any word in the transcript. \
    You will see a menu appear, with options for the 'Utterance' (the
    line), and the word.
18. Click the play option in the menu to see what it does.
19. Click on the *formats* link under the title. \
    You will see a menu, which includes various formats for exporting
    the transcript.
20. Select 'Plain Text Document'
21. Save the resulting file on your desktop, and then open it. \
    You will see the transcript in plain-text form.
22. Click the *formats* link, and select the 'Praat Text Grid' option.
23. Save the resulting file on your desktop, and then open it with
    Praat. \
    You will see that the TextGrid has various tiers, two for utterances
    (one for each speaker), and two for individual words (one for each
    speaker). \
    (You will see that each individual word has a \'default\'
    alignment - i.e. the words are evenly spread out during the duration
    of the line they\'re in. In a later exercise we will look at ways to
    make these word alignments actually line up with the words in the
    audio signal)

### Batch Upload

If you already have a collection of transcripts and media files (which
we have for these exercises), and they are systematically organized
(which they are), you may be able to save some manual uploading work by
uploading them using the 'batch upload' utility.

1.  In LaBB-CAT, click the *upload* option on the menu.
2.  Click the *upload transcript batch* link. \
    This shows a window with a large blank area in the middle with
    various buttons above it.
3.  Open Windows Explorer or Finder, and navigate to the LaBB-CAT
    Workshop data folder.
4.  Drag the folder called "QuakeStories", and drop it on to LaBB-CAT,
    on to the blank area below the buttons. \
    The previously blank area will contain a list of transcripts. Each
    transcript should have a value filled in for each column -
    *Transcript*, *Media*, *Corpus*, and *Episode*.
5.  Most of the transcripts are monologues, so set *Type* to *monologue*
    on the top left.
6.  One of the transcript is highlighted in orange, and the *Status*
    says "Already exists" - this is the transcript you manually
    uploaded. We don\'t need to upload it again, so remove it from the
    list by using the *x* button on the right hand side of that row.
7.  Click the *Upload* button above the list. \
    You will see that in the *Status* column, the text changes to
    "Uploading..." for the first transcript. The progress bar
    progresses, and once it\'s complete, the next transcript changes to
    "Transferring", and so on.
8.  While the files are uploading, click ![](help.png) the online help
    link next to the upload transcript batch link you clicked above and
    read the conditions that must be met in order to use the batch
    uploader. \
     
9.  Once the uploader is finished, you will receive a CSV report file
    that lists the files you uploaded and their upload status. (If there
    had been any problems with the upload, the resulting error messages
    would be included in this report for following up.)
10. You can verify that all the transcripts are there by clicking the
    *transcripts* option on the menu in LaBB-CAT. \
    You should see a list of twenty transcripts.
11. Use the "Transcript" box to find *UC013AM\_Dom.eaf* (You can type
    just part of the name if you like)
12. Click the *Attributes* button for *UC013AM\_Dom.eaf* (the one with
    the spanner/wrench icon).
13. Change *type* to *interview* and click *Save*.
14. Similarly, the following transcripts are interviews, so change their
    type accordingly
    -   UC215YW\_DanielaMaoate-Cox.eaf
    -   UC226AD.eaf

### Participant Data Import

The transcripts are now in the database, but the meta-data for the
participants hasn\'t been set yet (because it\'s not contained in the
ELAN files). We could manually add this for each speaker, but
fortunately we have it stored in a spreadsheet (actually, a CSV text
file) that we can upload in one go.

1.  In LaBB-CAT, click the *upload* option on the menu.
2.  Select the *upload participant data* option.
3.  Click *Choose File*, and select the file in the LaBB-CAT Exercises
    data folder called "participants.csv".
4.  Click *Upload*
5.  You will now see a list of the columns from the spreadsheet. \
    Firstly, ensure that the *Participant identity column* is set to
    *name*. This ensures that the \"name\" column in the spreadsheet
    will be used to match names of participants in the LaBB-CAT
    database.
6.  Below that is listed each column from the spreadsheet, with an arrow
    pointing to a dropdown box. The box contains various options,
    including each of the participant attributes set up in LaBB-CAT, an
    *ignore* option, and *create a new attribute* option. \
    Most likely, the correct options are already selected, as we\'ve
    already set up the correct participant attributes, but just check
    that they are as follows: \
    -   The CSV column **name:** → *ignore* because it\'s the
        *Participant Identity Column* identified above
    -   The CSV column **gender:** → the *Gender* LaBB-CAT attribute
    -   The CSV column **age\_category:** → the *Age* LaBB-CAT attribute
    -   The CSV column **ethnicity:** → the *Ethnicity* LaBB-CAT
        attribute
    -   The CSV column **grew\_up:** → the *grew\_up* LaBB-CAT attribute
    -   The CSV column **grew\_up\_region:** → the *grew\_up\_region*
        LaBB-CAT attribute
    -   The CSV column **grew\_up\_town:** → the *grew\_up\_town*
        LaBB-CAT attribute
    -   The CSV column **languages\_spoken:** → the *languages\_spoken*
        LaBB-CAT attribute
7.  Click *import*. \
    You should see a page with information about the import, including
    the columns that were ignored, and the number of participants that
    were added. \
    \
    To check the participant attributes really are now set: \
     
8.  Click the *participants* option on the menu. \
    You will see a list of speakers, and page links at the bottom. \
    The page also includes participant attribute values where they are
    known. \
    You can also filter the list by these values, using the column
    headings above the list.
9.  Under *Gender*, click the *F* option. \
    The page now lists only those with 'Female' set for the *Gender*
    attribute.

### Elicitation Tasks

LaBB-CAT can also make recordings of speech directly from the browser.

Let\'s suppose you want to record a number of participants reading lists
of words. You can define an 'Elicitation Task' that includes a series of
steps, one for each set of words you want participants to read.

First we\'re going to create a corpus to receive our recordings, and a
transcript type to mark the recordings as word lists \...

1.  In LaBB-CAT, click the *corpora* option on the menu.
2.  Add a corpus called *CC* with a description *Canterbury Corpus*.
3.  Click the *transcript types* option on the menu.
4.  Add a transcript type called *wordlist*.\
    \
    Now we\'ll create the elicitation task, which defines what prompts
    and texts the participant sees during the task.
5.  Click the \'elicitation tasks\' option on the menu. The page you see
    is a list of elicitation tasks defined, which is currently empty.
6.  Fill in the blank form with the following details:
    -   **ID:** nze-wordlist
    -   **description:** New Zealand English Word List
    -   **corpus:** *CC* (the corpus you just created)
    -   **transcript type:** *wordlist* (the transcript type you just
        created)
    -   **preamble:** "In this task your speech will be recorded. Please
        ensure you're in a quiet place." \
        This is the first text the participant sees when they access the
        task, before giving consent or going through the steps.
    -   **consent:** "I give consent for the use of my speech data for
        this research." \
        This is the text of the participant\'s consent for their
        participation and the use of their data. Before starting the
        task steps, they must \'sign\' this consent by typing their name
        in a box at the bottom. The text, with their name and the date
        incorporated, with be made into a PDF file which is uploaded
        with their recordings, and is made available for them to
        download. \
        \
        For both the preamble and the consent form, you can format the
        text with bold, italic, and underlined text, etc. by using the
        controls above the text area. \
        \
        ![](help.png) Check the online help on this page for further
        details about settings and important information about browser
        limitations. \
         
7.  Click *New* to add the task.
8.  Click *Define Steps*. \
    \
    On this page you are going to add steps for the task. The first
    step, called "Welcome", has already been added, and we\'ll use it
    for giving the participant some detailed instructions about what
    follows. We\'ll add a series of steps after the "Welcome" step, one
    for each group of words we want the participant to read. \
     
9.  The form you can see defines the details of the first "Welcome"
    step. \
    ![](help.png) Check the online help on this page for further details
    about this page and the options on it.
10. Close the online help page to return to the "define elicitation
    steps" page.
11. Fill in the following details:
    -   **Show:** *Always*
    -   **Countdown Seconds:** 0
    -   **Title:** Instructions
    -   **Prompt:** Please read aloud the following sets of words. Press
        \"Next\" after each set.
    -   **Elicit:** *Nothing*
    -   **Transcript:** (leave this box blank)
    -   **Image/Video:** *no image/video* \
        \
        Next we\'ll define what demographic information we will ask
        each \
        participant before they start recording. In this case, we will
        ask for \
        their gender and what languages they speak. \
         
12. Click the ![](add.png) button to add a new step.
13. Fill in the following details:
    -   **Show:** *Always*
    -   **Countdown Seconds:** 0
    -   **Title:** Languages
    -   **Prompt:** What languages do you speak?
    -   **Elicit:** *Attribute Value*
    -   **Attribute:** *participant\_languages\_spoken*
    -   **Image/Video:** *no image/video*
14. Click the ![](add.png) button to add a new step
15. Fill in the following details:
    -   **Show:** *Always*
    -   **Countdown Seconds:** 0
    -   **Title:** Gender
    -   **Prompt:** What is your gender?
    -   **Elicit:** *Attribute Value*
    -   **Attribute:** *participant\_gender*
    -   **Image/Video:** *no image/video* \
        \
        Now we can defined some prompts for them to read aloud.
16. Click the ![](add.png) button to add a new step
17. Fill in the following details:
    -   **Show:** *Always*
    -   **Countdown Seconds:** 0
    -   **Title:** (leave this box blank)
    -   **Prompt:** Please read the following aloud:
    -   **Elicit:** *Audio*
    -   **Transcript:** 1. hit hid hint
    -   **Max Seconds:** 30
    -   **Next Button:** *Shown*
    -   **Image/Video:** *no image/video*
18. Click the ![](add.png) button to add a new step
19. Fill in the same details as the previous step, except: \
    **Transcript:** 2. boot booed boo tune dune
20. Add a new step for **Transcript:** 3. bird curt burn
21. Add a new step for **Transcript:** 4. bat bad back bag ban
22. Add a new step for **Transcript:** 5. bet bed beck beg ben
23. Add one last step, with the following details:
    -   **Show:** *Always*
    -   **Countdown Seconds:** 0
    -   **Title:** Finished
    -   **Prompt:** Thanks for your participation!
    -   **Elicit:** *Nothing*
    -   **Transcript:** (leave this box blank)
    -   **Image/Video:** *no image/video* \
        \
        This last step is what is displayed to the participant when
        they\'ve finished all the steps. \
         
24. Click *Save Changes* \
    *![](TaskDefinition.png)* \
    \
    Your task is almost ready. We just need to define which options for
    *gender* they can see.
25. Click the *elicitation tasks* option on the menu.
26. Click *Participant Attributes*.
27. Click *Options* \
    This displays a list of the gender options that are visible to the
    participant. As you can see it\'s currently empty. In this case, we
    want to display all options for them to select.
28. Click *Add All* \
    You will see that all the options (M, F, and \'(not specified)\')
    have been added to the list. If you wanted to, you could edit the
    "description" of the individual items (e.g. translate them to
    another language if your participants don\'t speech English), or
    delete options you don\'t want them to be able to select.
29. Click the *Delete* button next to the '(not specified)' option, and
    click *OK* to confirm.
30. Click *Save Changes*. \
    \
    Your task is now fully defined and ready to go. \
    \
    Now you\'re going to run through the elicitation task yourself ... \
     
31. Click the *elicitation tasks* option on the menu.
32. Click the *Elicitation Task* button on the bottom right. \
    You should see a page that displays the task\'s \'preamble\' that
    you defined earlier.
33. Click *Next*. \
    You should see a page that displays the task\'s *consent* form that
    you defined earlier, with a box to enter your name in order to
    'sign' the consent.
34. Enter your name and click *Next*. \
    You will be given the chance to save your copy of the consent form.
35. Save the consent form and open it to check the contents.
36. Close the consent form to return to the task. \
    You should see a page with some text about enabling your
    microphone. \
    If you don\'t, and instead see a message about your browser not
    being supported, this means that your web browser doesn\'t support
    recording sound. In this case, copy the address of the page at the
    top, and paste it into another browser (e.g. Google Chrome or
    Mozilla Firefox).
37. Click *Next* and follow the instructions. \
    \
    Once you\'ve enabled your browser for access to your microphone, you
    will be asked for the demographic details you defined earlier. \
    \
    After you enter these, the task steps will begin, and you should
    follow the instructions, reading the prompts aloud and clicking
    *Next* after each group of words. \
    \
    Each time somebody performs the task, they\'re assigned a unique
    Participant ID, which is linked to their demographic data and the
    recordings. \
     
38. Click the *Back* button on your browser to return to the *define
    elicitation tasks* page in LaBB-CAT.
39. Click the *participants* option on the menu.
40. Under the *Corpus* heading, click the *CC* option. \
    You will see one participant; the one you just created by doing the
    task.
41. Click the participant ID to open their attributes page, and check
    that the demographic information you entered has been saved. \
    You will see that the participant has five transcripts, one for each
    of the task steps where audio was recorded.
42. Open the first transcript. \
    You will see that the transcript starts with a comment, which is the
    prompt text you were shown during the step, and that the transcript
    contains one utterance.
43. Play the audio to ensure it was recorded correctly. \
    (If the last transcript you looked at had video, you may need to
    tick the checkbox next to the "wav" option in the top right corner,
    in order to select audio for playback.)

Although these \'task step\' transcripts are very short, they behave the
same as any other transcript; they can be exported, annotated, searched,
etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

You now have a small database with a number of speakers in it, so we can
start creating some annotations and doing some searches \... \
