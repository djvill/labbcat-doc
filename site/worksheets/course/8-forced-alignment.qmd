# 8. Forced Alignment

Forced alignment is the process of automatically determining the start
and end times of words, and the phones within each word.

The options for forced alignment are:

-   [HTK](8a-forced-alignment-htk.qmd) - the Hidden Markov Model Toolkit
-   [MFA](8b-forced-alignment-mfa.qmd) - the Montreal Forced Aligner
