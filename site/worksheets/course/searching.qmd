# 3 - Searching

Now that you have some transcripts in your database, we\'ll try out
LaBB-CAT\'s search functions a little.

Searching broadly involves the following steps:

1.  Selecting participants whose utterances you want to search,
2.  Specifying one or more patterns to search for, and
3.  Exploring or extracting the search results.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We\'ll start with a very simple search - all the instances of the word
\"the\" uttered by monolingual English-speaking males.

1.  In LaBB-CAT, click on the *participant* link on the menu.\
    This takes you to a page listing all participants, where you can
    filter participants by their attributes. You can see various
    participant attributes listed across the top of page.
2.  We\'re interested in male participants, so under the *Gender*,
    select *M*.\
    After a short delay the page will display a list of all the male
    participants in the database.
3.  We want the participants who speak only English, so enter `English`
    under *Languages Spoken*\
    The page will then display a list of male participants who include
    *English* in their languages. It also includes participants who
    speak other languages, who we want to eliminate.\
    The *Languages* filter box accepts a 'regular expression' so if we
    enter `^English$` in the box, only those with English as their sole
    language will be listed. This is because, in regular expressions,
    *\^* means "the beginning" and *\$* means "the end", so
    *\^English\$* means, "English at the beginning, and at the end"
4.  Click *Layered Search* at the top.\
    You will see the participants you selected listed at the top, above
    a list of annotation layers. Below that, there\'s a "Search Matrix",
    although it doesn\'t look much like a matrix yet, because it\'s only
    one layer high and one word wide...
5.  In the box next to the word "orthography" type the word `the`\
    ![](orthography-the.png)
6.  Now click the *Search* button at the bottom (or hit *\<Enter\>*).\
    A progress bar will appear, and then shortly after that, a new tab
    will open, which has a list of search results in it. Your browser\'s
    popup-blocker might prevent the results page from opening - you can
    fix that either by allowing the popups in your browser, or by
    clicking the *Display results* link that appears after the search
    finishes.
7.  Each match is highlighted and shown with some context (the previous
    word and the following word in the transcript). The amount of
    context is controlled by a drop-down list at the top.\
    Select *5 words* to see more context around each match.
8.  Click on the first match.\
    You will see that the interactive transcript page opens in a new
    browser tab, with the match at the top, and highlighted. You will
    also see that all the other matches from the same transcript are
    also highlighted.
9.  We\'ve already seen what can be done in the interactive transcript
    page, so close the tab to return to the results page.
10. Each result line has a ticked checkbox next to it. Scroll to the
    bottom of the list.\
    You\'ll see that there are buttons at the bottom, which perform
    operations on the ticked results, including *CSV Export*, *Utterance
    Export*, and *Audio Export*.
11. Un-tick the "Select all results" checkbox, and then tick a handful
    of results in the list.    \
    *Tip:* You can select a group of matches by ticking the first one,
    and then holding down the *\<Shift\>* key while ticking the last
    one.
12. Click the *Audio Export* button.
13. Save and open the resulting zip file.\
    You\'ll see that the files are systematically named to include:
    -   the name of the transcript
    -   the start and end time of the extracted utterance
14. Now go back to the results page and tick the *Prefix Names*
    checkbox.
15. Click the *Audio Export* button again.
16. Save and open the resulting zip file.\
    This time you\'ll see that the files are also prefixed by the result
    number.\
    You may notice that there are more audio files this time; that\'s
    because there were multiple results in the same utterance.
    Previously, only one copy of the utterance was exported, but this
    time, each match has its own copy of the utterance audio, prefixed
    by the result number.
17. Now go back to the results page and un-tick the *Prefix Names*
    checkbox.
18. Click the *Utterance Export* button.
19. Save and open the resulting zip file.\
    You\'ll see that the TextGrid names match the audio file names in
    the first zip file.
20. Open one of the TextGrids in Praat.\
    You\'ll see that the TextGrid includes a tier named *target...*
    which indicates which token(s) in the *word...* tier matched the
    search pattern.
21. Back on the results page, click the *CSV Export* button.
22. Save the resulting file, and open it.\
    You may have to specify some import options, in which case it may be
    handy to know that the field separator is comma, and the fields are
    quoted by speech marks.    \
    *Tip:* If you\'re using Microsoft Excel and you find it doesn\'t
    open all the columns correctly:
    1.  Create a new workbook in Excel.
    2.  Click the \'Data\' tab.
    3.  On the \"Get External Data\" ribbon click \'From Text\'.
    4.  Select the CSV file you downloaded.
    5.  Select \'Delimited\' and click *Next*.
    6.  Ensure \'Comma\' is the only delimiter ticked and click *Next*.
    7.  Click *Finish* and then *OK*.\
        \
        You will see a spreadsheet with one line per selected result,
        and various columns containing information about the speaker,
        the corpus, the match line and word, and a URL to the
        interactive transcript for the match.\
        With this spreadsheet, you can work \'offline\' with the
        results, tagging them, computing statistics in Excel, R, or any
        other program that can work with CSV files. We\'ll look at a few
        more uses for the CSV results files later...\
         
23. Close the CSV file, and the results page, and go back to the search
    matrix page.\
    \
    We\'ve seen that you can search for exact word matches, but you can
    also search for patterns, using \'regular expressions\'. Now we\'re
    going to search for words *beginning with* "the\..."\
     
24. Change the *orthography* search text to `the.*` (i.e. after the word
    \"the\", append a full-stop and an asterisk.\
    ![](starts-the.png)    \
     The full-stop means "any character at all", and the asterisk means
    "zero or more of the previous thing", so *.\** means \"zero or more
    characters\".
25. Click *Search*.\
    You will see that now the search results include the word \"the\"
    and also words like \"then\", \"there\", \"they\", etc.
26. Now go back to the search page, and change the asterisk to a
    plus-sign, which means "one or more of the previous thing"\
    ![](prefix-the.png)
27. Click *Search*\
    You will see that now the search results exclude the word \"the\",
    only including words where the initial \"the\...\" is followed by at
    least one character.
28. Now change your search by replacing the *e* in \"the\" with
    *\[aeiou\]* - so your search pattern will be:\
    `th[aeiou].+`\
    The square-brackets mean "any one of the things inside the
    brackets", so *\[aeiou\]* means "any vowel".\
    \
    *Tip:* while you are typing the regular expression, you may notice
    that the text goes red; this means that what\'s currently in the box
    is not a valid regular expression. That\'s fine while you\'re still
    typing, but when you\'re ready to search, if the text is red, the
    search will likely fail. If the regular expression text is red, you
    can see what the problem with it is by hovering your mouse over the
    red text; a 'tip' will appear showing an error message.\
     
29. Click *Search*.\
    You will now see that the results include words like \"think\",
    \"that\", \"thought\", etc.\
    ![](help.png) You can get more information about regular expressions
    by using the online help on the search page, and also by clicking
    the the *regular expressions* link above the search matrix.\
    \
    Up until now, we\'ve only been matching against one word at a time.
    Now we\'re going to include patterns for a chain of words...\
     
30. On the search page, to the right of the search matrix, there\'s a
    *+* button. Click it.\
    ![](two-words-wide.png)    \
    Now you will see that our search matrix is one layer high by two
    words wide.
31. Change the entries on the *orthography* layer so that it will match
    the word \"the\" followed immediately by a word that starts with a
    vowel, and click *Search*.\
    Check the search results are giving you what you expected.
32. Now search for \"the\" followed, within two words, by a word that
    starts with a vowel.
33. Dream up some other searches that interest you, and try out other
    options on the search page.
