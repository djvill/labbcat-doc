# LaBB-CAT Documentation

This is the documentation for the [LaBB-CAT](https://labbcat.canterbury.ac.nz/) corpus management system.

LaBB-CAT is a browser-based linguistics research tool that stores audio or video recordings, text transcripts, and other annotations.

Annotations of various types can be automatically generated or manually added.

The transcripts and annotations can be searched for particular text or regular expressions. The search results, or entire transcripts, can be viewed or saved in a variety of formats, and the related parts of the recordings can be played or opened in acoustic analysis software, all directly through the web-browser.
