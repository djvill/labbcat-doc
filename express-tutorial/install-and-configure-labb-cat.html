<h2>1 - Install and Configure LaBB-CAT</h2>
 <p>In this exercise you will:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>Install the LaBB-CAT software</li>
  <li>Define corpora</li>
  <li>Define transcript types</li></ul>
 <p>After this you will have an empty LaBB-CAT database set up ready to upload transcripts into.</p>
<hr>
 <ol>
  <li>You have a file called <i>install-labbcat.jar</i> - double click this file to start the installer.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <br>If you are using OS X, you may see a message that the file can't be opened:&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <br><img src="./install-labbcat-OSX-warning.png"> &nbsp;
  <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;If this happens:
 <ol>
  <li>Click the Apple icon in the top left corner of the screen.</li>
  <li>Select <i>System Preferences</i></li>
  <li>Click <i>Security &amp; Privacy</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <br>Near the bottom it says "<i>install-labbcat.jar" was blocked from opening because it is not from an identified developer.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <br><img src="./install-labbcat-OSX-open-anyway.png"></li>
  <li>Click <i>Open Anyway</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <br>You may see another warning about the program being downloaded from the internet&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <br><img src="./install-labbcat-OSX-open.png"></li>
  <li>Click <i>Open</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <br>
  <br><i><img src="./install-labbcat.png"></i>&nbsp;</li></ol></li>
  <li>Click <i>Start</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <br>You will see the progress bar move as files are installed. Once this is finished, you'll see a message saying ‚Äú<i>Installation complete.</i>‚Äù</li>
  <li>Click <i>Finished</i> to close the installer</li></ol>
 <p>The software is now installed. LaBB-CAT is a browser-based system, which means that it works as a mini web server on your computer, and you need to access it using your web browser.</p>
 <p>Each time you want to use LaBB-CAT, you must start it up, and which you've finished, you close it down again.</p>
 <p>To start LaBB-CAT, click the LaBB-CAT icon in your applications area.</p>
 <ul>
  <li>On Windows, open the <i>Start</i> menu and type LaBB-CAT.</li>
  <li>On OS X you will find LaBB-CAT in your <i>Applications</i> folder.</li></ul>
 <p>A window called "LaBB-CAT Server" will open, and after a short delay, your default web browser will open on a page called "LaBB-CAT".</p>
 <p>Now that the software is installed, we will set up a basic structure for receiving data:</p>
 <ol>
  <li>Start LaBB-CAT as described above.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <br>This will open your web browser on LaBB-CAT's start page.</li>
  <li>The very first time this opens, you will see the software's licence. Click <i>I Agree</i> to access the start page.</li>
  <li>The start page has a link on it called ‚Äú<i>Where do I start?</i>‚Äù - you may like to click on this link and read the first section, which explains a little about how to navigate around LaBB-CAT and where to find online help and hints.</li>
  <li>Click back on the start page of LaBB-CAT (the page with the ‚Äú<i>Where do I start?</i>‚Äù link).&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <br>
  <br>Now we will set up some corpus names‚Ä¶</li>
  <li>On the menu at the top, click the <i>corpora</i> link.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <br>This page shows a list of current corpora, which only contains one corpus, called <i>corpus</i>.</li>
  <li>The column headings at the top, <i>Name</i>, <i>Language</i>, and <i>Description</i>, also make a form you can fill in to create a new corpus. Fill in the following information:
 <ul>
  <li><strong>Name:</strong> QB</li>
  <li><strong>Language:</strong> <i>English</i></li>
  <li><strong>Description:</strong> Quakebox recordings</li></ul></li>
  <li>Click the <i>New</i> button on the right to add the <i>QB</i> corpus.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <br>You should see a message at the top of the page saying ‚ÄúRecord created‚Äù and now the <i>QB</i> corpus is in the list, under the <i>corpus</i> corpus.</li>
  <li>Add another corpus called <i>UC</i> with the description ‚ÄúCampus recordings‚Äù</li>
  <li>We won't actually be using the corpus called <i>corpus</i>, so we want to delete it. To do this, click the <i>Delete</i> button to the right of the 'corpus' corpus in the list.</li>
  <li>You will be asked ‚ÄúAre you sure you want to delete this record?‚Äù&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <br>You are sure, so click <i>OK</i>.&nbsp;
  <br>The row will be deleted from the list.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <br>
  <br>Now you have some corpora set up with the names you've provided.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <br>
  <br>The data we are using is a collection of stories about peoples' experiences during the devastating earthquakes that hit the Canterbury region of New Zealand in 2010 and 2011. Some recordings are interviews, where an interviewer asks the participant questions, and others are monologues. Now we're going to set up these two transcript types ‚Ä¶</li>
  <li>Click on the <i>transcript types</i> menu option.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <br>You will see a list of transcript types, although there's currently only one type in the list, called 'interview'.</li>
  <li>Above this, fill in the empty <i>Type</i> box with the word: monologue</li>
  <li>Click the <i>New</i> button on the right.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  <br>You will notice that now the list has two transcript types, <i>interview </i>and <i>monologue</i>.</li>
  <li>Click the <i>Save</i> button that has appeared below the other buttons to confirm this change.&nbsp;
  <br>You will see a message at the top saying ‚ÄúUpdated transcript types‚Äù.</li></ol>
 <p>Now you have an empty database for which you've:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>created two corpora, QB and UC, and</li>
  <li>created a new transcript type, so that we can have monologues as well as interviews.</li></ul></article>
